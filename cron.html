    <header><h1>Using Cronjobs to run scheduled tasks</h1></header>
    <nav></nav>
    <main>
        <p>
        Cron is a service that lets you run scheduled tasks. These tasks are called <strong> cronjobs. </strong> If you have already followed the initial course you will have already used cron when you set up certbot. 
        </p>
        <h2> What tasks would I want to schedule? </h2>
        <p>
        You can schedule anything! Some examples of what you might have done already include:
        <ul>
            <li> <code> updatedb </code> to update your <code> locate </code> database </li>
            <li> <code> certbot </code> to update renewing of your https certs </li>
        </ul>
        Some tasks that you might <em>want</em> to schedule may include:
        <ul>
            <li> Package updates - if you really just want to leave your server alone you can automated updating packages on your server </li>
            <li> Backups - you may want to backup certain files every day and some every week, this is possible with cron </li>
        </ul>
            <p>
            And many more, anything you can do can be turned into a cronjob.
            </p>

            <h2> How do I schedule things? </h2>

            <p>
            You can schedule tasks in the following ways:
            <ol>
                <li> Your users crontab </li>
                <li> System wide cron directories </li>
            </ol>

            

            <h3> Your user crontab </h3>

            <p> 
            This the preferred method for personal tasks and scripts, it's also the easiest to get started with. Run the command <code> crontab -e </code> to access your users crontab
            </p>
            <aside>
                <p>
                These crontabs are located at <code> /var/spool/cron/crontabs/ </code> If you wanted to you can edit these files instead of running <code> crontab -e </code>
                </p>
            </aside>
            
            <p>
            Once you have figured out the command you want to run you need to figure out how often you want to run it and when. I am going to schedule my system updates once a week on at 3:30 AM on a Monday. 
            </p>
            <p>
            We now have to convert this time (Every Monday at 3:30 AM) into a cron time. Cron uses a simple but effective way of scheduling when to run things.
            </p>
            <p>
            Crontab expressions look like this <code> * * * * * command-to-run </code> 
            <pre>
				 .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
				 |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
				 |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
				 |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12
				 |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) 
				 |  |  |  |  |
				 *  *  *  *  *
			</pre>
            <br>
			<aside> 
				<p> Run the command <code> cat /etc/crontab </code> to see something similar to the above </p>
			</aside>
			
            <p>
            So for our Monday at 3:30AM job we would do the following:
            <pre>
            <code> 30 3 * * 1 apt-get -y update && apt-get -y dist-upgrade </code>
            </pre>
            <br>
            <aside class=callout>
                <p>
                For day of the week field (the last field), the week starts on a Sunday, so Monday is <code> 1 </code> 
                </p>
            </aside>
            <br>
            <aside>
                <p>
                The website <a href="crontab.guru">https://crontab.guru</a> is insanely helpful for figuring out specific cron timings
                </p>
            </aside>
            <p> 
            Lets add another Job, our backup job (for the purposes of this our backup command is just called <code> backup </code> We want to run <code> backup </code> Every evening at 11PM, once we work out the timings for this we can add the to the same file as the above by running <code> crontab -e </code> This would mean our full crontab would look like this:
            <pre>
            <code> 30 3 * * 1 apt-get -y update && apt-get -y dist-upgrade </code>
            <code> 0 23 * * * backup </code>
            </pre>

            <h3> System wide cron directories </h3>

            <p>
            Run the command <code> ls /etc/cron* </code> you should see a list of directories and there contents. The directories should be something like the below
            <ul>
                <li> /etc/cron.d  <em> This is a crontab like the ones that you create with </em> <code> crontab -e </code> </li>
                <li> /etc/cron.hourly </li>
                <li> /etc/cron.daily </li>
                <li> /etc/cron.weekly </li>
                <li> /etc/cron.monthly </li>
            </ul>

            <p>

            The directories cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly} are where you can put <strong> scripts </strong> to run at those times. You don't put normal cron entries here. I prefer to use these directories for system wide jobs that don't relate to an individual user. For example If we wanted to put our backup job in <code> /etc/cron.daily </code> we would do the following:
            <ol>
                <li> Create and edit the file <code> /etc/cron.daily/backup/ </code>:
                    <ul> 
                        <li> <code> vim /etc/cron.daily/backup </code> </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Add the backup command in there, we can also add some logging because it's a full script. The full thing will look like this: </li>
                    <p>
                            <pre>
 #!/bin/sh

 # the logger command generates system logs
 logger "starting backup daily job"
 
 # backup is hypothetical backup command
 backup 

 logger "finished backing up"
                            </pre>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li> Save that file </li>
                <li> Make that executable: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> <code> chmod +x /etc/cron.daily/backup </code> </li>
                </ul>
            </ol>

            <p>
            It's that easy, no messing around with cron timers! A downside of this is that you can't choose when these run, most of the time they will run at ~6:30am every hour,day,week,month.
            </p>

            <p>
            That's it! There is not much more to know about cron. Hopefully you now know the appropriate cron method and have the ability to correctly schedule your tasks.
            </p>
